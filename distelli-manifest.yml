  Build:
    - echo "Nothing to build"
  Env:
    # This can be overridden in the App Env Variables in Distelli WebUI
    NVM_VERSION: "v0.31.7"
  Install:
    # Download nvm and install
    # Note, that since this is being done by the Distelli user, this will be installed
    #  into: /home/distelli/.nvm
    #  Which is not bad as builds and deploys are run as the distelli user.
    #  When building/deploying, typically you would use this as so:
    #
    #  DISTELLI_USERNAME/DISTELLI_APPNAME:
    #    Build:
    #      - source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    #      - nvm install v4.4.7
    #      - npm install
    #      - npm test
    #    PkgInclude:
    #      - '*'
    #    Exec:
    #      - source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    #      - nvm install v4.4.7
    #      - nodejs app.js
    #
    - curl -o- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/$NVM_VERSION/install.sh' | bash
